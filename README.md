# hardin_networkemulator
2 Python files (emulator, requester) that were created in conjunction with a sender file (not added) as a part of my CS 640 course

The files in conjunction with a sender file emulate a "network" where the requester will send request packets to senders through an emulator and senders will begin responding with data packets that are queued in the emulator to be sent back.

I did not add my sender.py file as that code is done completely by another person.
